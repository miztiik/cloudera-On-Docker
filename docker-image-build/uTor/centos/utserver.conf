## utserver.conf
## Configuration settings template for µTorrent for Linux.
## Taken from µTorrent Server manual for version alpha-3.3.
## ©2013 BitTorrent, Inc.
## Compiled by Rich.T.
##

##
## Command-line Arguments
##

## µTorrent Server supports the following arguments - the keywords are
## case-insensitive and should be immediately preceded with a dash (-):

## ? configfile - path to and name of the configuration file - if this
##   argument is not specified, the utserver program looks for a file named
##   utserver.conf in the current working directory - see the following
##   section for more details
## ? logfile - path to and name of the log file - specifying -logfile
##   filename will direct log output to filename, while specifying -logfile
##   without a filename will direct log file output to utserver.log in the
##   current working directory
## ? settingspath - path to directory to store files of relatively small
##   size (operational settings, torrent resume information, RSS feed
##   information) - if not specified, the utserver program will store these
##   files in the current working directory
## ? pidfile - path to and name of the file to create that will contain the
##   process ID of the utserver process
## ? daemon - directs the server to run in its own process group
## ? usage - directs the server to generate message describing supported
##   arguments and then exit

## Configuration File

## At startup the utserver process looks for a configuration file which allows the
## behavior of the product to be customized by changing the values of certain
## settings. The format of this file is as follows:

## ? each setting is on a separate line;
## ? each line consists of colon-separated name of the setting and its
##   value;
## ? any line whose first non-whitespace character is # is a comment.

## For example, a file that sets two values and includes one comment might look
## like:

# This is a comment
## dir_temp_files: temp
## preferred_interface: eth0

## For a complete list of application settings, see Application Settings.

## Environment

## When the utserver process creates files intended for end users, such as torrent
## data files, it uses the value of the file mode creation mask to specify access
## to these files. For more information, run man umask on a Linux command line.
## The value of the file mode creation mask is not considered when creating files
## not intended for use by users, such as settings files.

## Ensure the locale used by the utserver process supports your preferred
## character set or that of your users. By default, without explicit
## configuration, utserver running on some Linux devices will support only the
## 8-bit C/POSIX locales. Choose a locale that supports UTF-8 or other character
## set that is more likely to support the torrents created by the international
## community of BitTorrent users. Set the LANG environment variable to your choice
## of locale, and ensure your desired locale is supported on the computer running
## utserver.

## Application Settings

## Settings fall into two categories:

## ? internal settings, whose values can only be set in the utserver.conf
##   file;
## ? regular settings, whose values can be set in the utserver.conf file or
##   the /api/app-settings-set RPC API call.

## A setting can be of one of three types:

## ? string
## ? integer
## ? Boolean value (1 for true and 0 for false)

##
## Internal Settings
##

# bind_ip:
## bind_ip (string):
## IP address to use for socket connections. If not provided, a default IP
## address will be used. We do not recommend changing this value.

# ut_webui_port:
## ut_webui_port (integer):
## Default value: 8080. Port number where the utserver process accepts HTTP
## RPC API calls to support the µTorrent-compatible HTTP interface. If the
## utserver process also serves HTML files (see webui_server_files setting),
## also the port of HTTP server.

# token_auth_enable:
## token_auth_enable (boolean)
## Default value: true. If true, the µTorrent HTTP interface defends against
## cross-site request forgeries by requiring that a short-lived token be
## obtained from the µTorrent HTTP interface and included at the beginning of
## the parameter list of any request made to that interface. If false, the
## µTorrent HTTP interface will not be protected in this manner.

# dir_active:
## dir_active (string):
## Default value: "./". Directory in which currently downloaded data is saved.
## Can be an absolute path or a relative path. If it is a relative path, the
## value is relative to dir_root or the current working directory if dir_root
## is not defined or an empty string. It is recommended that this directory be
## hidden from users (i.e. not exported through Samba).

# dir_completed:
## dir_completed (string):
## Default value: "". Directory where completed downloads are stored. If the
## value is an empty string, the value of dir_active is used. This value must
## represent a path that is accessible to users (e.g. exported through Samba).
## It also has to be on the same volume as dir_active.

# dir_download:
## dir_download (string):
## Default value: "". Optional directory where completed downloads can be
## stored, instead of in dir_completed. If no value is specified for this
## setting, the value of dir_completed is used. The value must represent a
## path that is accessible to users (e.g. exported through Samba).

## This option can be specified multiple times in the file - once for each
## directory to be designated as such. This option can be used when adding
## torrents via the µTorrent HTTP interface, not via the SDK interface.

## Use the action list-dirs to obtain a list of download directories from the
## µTorrent HTTP interface. Use the option download_dir to specify which of
## these directories to use when adding a torrent by URL or file through the
## µTorrent HTTP interface; specify the one-based index of the entry of
## interest. The index of each entry will be in order in which each entry
## appears in utserver.conf, starting with 1 for the first entry, 2 for the
## second entry, and so on. 0 indicates the default download directory should
## be used.

## The value of this setting will be applied every time the utserver process
## starts or the configuration file is reloaded.

# dir_torrent_files:
## dir_torrent_files (string):
## Default value: "". Directory where torrent files are stored. If the empty
## string, the value of dir_active is used. It is recommended that this
## directory be hidden from users (i.e. not exported through Samba).

# dir_temp_files:
## dir_temp_files (string):
## Default value: "". Directory where temporary files are stored. If the empty
## string, the value of dir_active is used. It is recommended that this
## directory be hidden from users (i.e. not exported through Samba). Also,
## using a separate directory just for temporary files allows for deleting the
## files in this directory on boot and/or periodically. The utserver process
## creates temporary files with a .utt extension - if a value for this setting
## is specified, the utserver process will delete all files with that
## extension in that directory at process startup. This setting applies only
## to POSIX systems. The value should specify a directory, not a symbolic link
## to a directory.

# dir_autoload:
## dir_autoload (string):
## Default value: "". Directory where torrent files will be recognized and
## auto-loaded. If the empty string, auto-load is disabled.

# dir_autoload_delete:
## dir_autoload_delete (boolean):
## Default value: false. If true, torrent files in the autoload directory will
## be deleted after being loaded, else they will be renamed with an extension
## of .loaded. The dir_autoload setting must be specified for this setting to
## have an effect.

# dir_request:
## dir_request (string):
## Default value: "". Directory where maintenance request files will be
## recognized, loaded, and deleted. If the empty string, maintenance request
## handling is disabled.

## Software running on the server can create the following files in this
## directory in order to request the following maintenance procedures.

## If the file c.utmr is created in or moved into this directory, the
## credentials necessary to access the µTorrent HTTP interface will be reset
## to username admin and a blank password.

## If the file wipl.utmr is created in or moved into this directory, the IP
## restriction list that limits the IPs that can use the µTorrent HTTP
## interface is cleared, so that there will be no restrictions on IP address.

## These maintenance operations provide a way to help a user who has either
## entered new credentials and then forgotten them, or who has entered an IP
## range in the restricted list and can no longer access the µTorrent HTTP
## interface as a result.

## If the file rcf.utmr is created in or moved into this directory, the server
## will reload the configuration file. If you always use this method to
## request a configuration file reload, you can safely change the value of
## this setting while the server is running.

## The server will also reload the configuration file if you send a hangup
## signal to the server; however, a race condition may occur if you send a
## hangup signal to the server in order to change the value of this setting.
## You should either only use the file system interface for requesting
## configuration file reloads, or you should not change the value of this
## setting in the configuration file before sending a hangup signal to the
## server.

## If the file sp.utmr is created in or moved into this directory, the
## utserver process will exit after performing normal shutdown processing such
## as saving settings files and torrent resume data. This can be useful for
## changing configuration file settings that are best applied on process
## startup.

## Ensure the access permissions for this directory permit only appropriate
## authenticated users and/or processes to create, list, and delete files.
## This directory should be unavailable to other users and processes (i.e.,
## not exported through Samba). If you want a requesting process to create
## maintenance request files in this directory, ensure that both the
## requesting process and the utserver process have rights to this directory.

## The value of this setting will be applied every time the utserver process
## starts or the configuration file is reloaded.

# upnp:
## upnp (boolean):
## Default value: true. If true, UPNP functionality for mapping ports is used
## by utserver. We recommend setting this value to true.

# natpmp:
## natpmp (boolean):
## If true, NAT-PMP functionality for mapping ports is used by utserver.
## Default value: true. We recommend setting this value to true.

# lsd:
## lsd (boolean):
## Default value: true. If true, Local Service Discovery is enabled. We
## recommend setting this value to true.

# dht:
## dht (boolean):
## Default value: true. If true, Distributed Hash Table extension is enabled.
## We recommend setting this value to true.

# pex:
## pex (boolean):
## Default value: true. If true, Peer Exchange extension is enabled. We
## recommend setting this value to true.

# rate_limit_local_peers:
## rate_limit_local_peers (boolean):
## Default value: false. If true, rate limiting also applies to communications
## with peers in the local subnet. We recommend setting this value to false.

# dir_root:
## dir_root (string):
## Default value: "". If not empty, dir_active, dir_completed, and
## dir_torrent_files are relative to this directory.

# disk_cache_max_size:
## disk_cache_max_size (integer):
## Default value: 0. Maximum amount of memory used by each of the read, write,
## and piece caches. Value is in megabytes. If 0, accepts the server's default
## choices on selecting sizes of disk caches. Maximum value is 512.

## The value of this setting will be applied every time the utserver process
## starts or the configuration file is reloaded.

# write_coalesce_max_size:
## write_coalesce_max_size (integer):
## Default value: 0. The maximum amount of contiguous torrent file data that
## will be held before writing it to disk. Adjusting this value may affect
## disk write efficiency on some systems. Value is in megabytes. Maximum value
## is 32. If 0, accepts the server's default (2) on selecting sizes of writes
## to coalesce. If -1, disables write caching.

## The value of this setting will be applied every time the utserver process
## starts or the configuration file is reloaded.

# progressive_piece_span:
## progressive_piece_span (integer):
## Default value: 0. The maximum amount of readahead for torrents that are
## being downloaded in the more sequential progressive mode (as opposed to the
## more random rarest-first mode). Value is in megabytes. Maximum value is
## 1024. If 0, accepts the server's default (80) on maximum readahead on
## progressive downloads. If -1, disables progressive piece picker.

## The value of this setting will be applied every time the utserver process
## starts or the configuration file is reloaded.

# preferred_interface:
## preferred_interface (string):
## Default value: "". If defined, name of network interface to be preferred
## when attempting to search among network interfaces for an external IP and
## hardware address. If empty string, preferred interface is ignored.

## You need to provide a value for this setting if either 1) the toolchain for
## your computer does not supply ifaddrs.h, or 2) you want the utserver
## process to choose a different interface than it would choose on its own.
## You should set a value for this setting if you see an incorrect port
## mapping on a UPnP router for the subnet to which the device belongs (the IP
## address of the device will not appear in the port mapping requested by the
## utserver process - instead, the IP address associated with the mapping will
## be 0.0.0.0 with a device having a toolchain that does not include
## ifaddrs.h, or some other IP address with a device having a toolchain that
## includes ipaddrs.h).

## The value of this setting will be applied every time the utserver process
## starts or the configuration file is reloaded.

# admin_name:
## admin_name (string):
## Default value: "admin". If defined, name that must be supplied (along with
## the password) when authenticating to the server via the HTTP interface.
## This allows the administrator to define an initial non-default value for
## this name. This value will not be applied from utserver.conf if
## settings.dat already exists.

# admin_password:
## admin_password (string):
## Default value: "". If defined, password that must be supplied (along with
## the name) when authenticating to the server via the HTTP interface. This
## allows the administrator to define an initial non-default value for this
## password. This value will not be applied from utserver.conf if settings.dat
## already exists.

# localhost_authentication:
## localhost_authentication (boolean):
## Default value: true. If false, HTTP requests originating from the local
## host will not be required to include administrative user name and password.
## Disabling authentication of requests originating on the local host may be
## useful on computers where there are no other users or processes that
## shouldn't be prevented from accessing the HTTP interface. Disabling
## authentication presents a security risk on those computers that support
## untrusted users or allow third-party applications to be installed and run
## outside the control of the administrator.

## The value of this setting will be applied every time the utserver process
## starts or the configuration file is reloaded.

# logmask:
## logmask (integer):
## Default value: 0. A mask whose bits when set allow certain categories of
## log messages to be generated. The value of this setting will be applied
## every time the utserver process starts or the configuration file is
## reloaded.

## The bits (0 - 31) in the value of this setting correspond to a set of
## internal events and subsystems. The usage of these bits may change without
## advance notice in a future release.

## ? 3 - send have
## ? 6 - hole punch
## ? 7 - got bad piece request
## ? 8 - trace
## ? 9 - piece picker
## ? 10 - got bad cancel
## ? 11 - got bad unchoke
## ? 12 - got bad piece
## ? 13 - rss
## ? 14 - rss error
## ? 15 - got have
## ? 16 - got bad have
## ? 17 - error
## ? 18 - aggregated
## ? 19 - disconnect
## ? 20 - out connect
## ? 21 - in connect
## ? 22 - UPnP
## ? 23 - UPnP error
## ? 24 - NATPMP
## ? 25 - NATPMP error
## ? 26 - metadata finish
## ? 27 - web UI
## ? 28 - got bad reject
## ? 29 - pex
## ? 30 - peer messages
## ? 31 - blocked connect

# ut_webui_dir:
## ut_webui_dir (string):
## Directory where the web UI file archive webui.zip is stored, or which
## contains a webui subdirectory within which the unarchived web UI files are
## stored. It can be an absolute path or set relative to the current
## directory. It is recommended that this directory be hidden from users (i.e.
## not exported through Samba). Default value: "" (to use the same directory
## as settings.dat and other settings files).

## The value of this setting will be applied every time the utserver process
## starts or the configuration file is reloaded.

# finish_cmd:
## finish_cmd (string), state_cmd (string):
## If defined, finish_cmd is a command that will be executed upon completion
## of each torrent, and state_cmd is a command that will be executed when a
## torrent changes state. Default value: "" (no command is run for the event
## (s) associated with that setting).

## The command is run asynchronously, so that a lengthy or hung process will
## not block the server. The server creates a new process group for the
## command, so that the server does not need to wait for it, and so the kernel
## process table does not fill up with zombie processes. The command is run as
## the same user that runs the server process.

## The server permits substitutions in the command text as follows:

## %F
## Name of downloaded data file (for single-file torrents)
## %D
## directory where torrent data files are saved
## %N
## torrent title
## %S
## torrent state
## %P
## previous state of torrent
## %L
## label associated with torrent
## %T
## tracker
## %M
## status message
## %I
## hex-encoded info-hash

## State (%S) and previous state (%P) are integers that have the following
## values:

## ? 1 (error)
## ? 2 (checked)
## ? 3 (paused)
## ? 4 (super seeding)
## ? 5 (seeding)
## ? 6 (downloading)
## ? 7 (super seeding (forced))
## ? 8 (seeding (forced))
## ? 9 (downloading (forced))
## ? 10 (queued seed)
## ? 11 (finished)
## ? 12 (queued)
## ? 13 (stopped)

# uconnect_enable:
## uconnect_enable (boolean):
## Default value: false. If true, the values of uconnect_username and
## uconnect_password are provided when authenticating to µTorrent Remote. The
## value of this setting will be applied every time the utserver process
## starts or the configuration file is reloaded. This value is always applied
## from utserver.conf; it is not saved in settings.dat.

# uconnect_username:
## uconnect_username (string):
## Default value: "". If defined, name that must be supplied (along with the
## password) when authenticating to µTorrent Remote. The value of this setting
## will be applied every time the utserver process starts or the configuration
## file is reloaded. This value is always applied from utserver.conf; it is
## not saved in settings.dat.

# uconnect_password:
## uconnect_password (string):
## Default value: "". If defined, password that must be supplied (along with
## the name) when authenticating to µTorrent Remote. The value of this setting
## will be applied every time the utserver process starts or the configuration
## file is reloaded. This value is always applied from utserver.conf; it is
## not saved in settings.dat.

# low_cpu:
## low_cpu (boolean):
## Default value: false. If true, a short sleep occurs during the process of
## handling network traffic, so that network traffic handling presents less of
## a load on the CPU. This value will not be applied from utserver.conf if
## settings.dat already exists.

# sequential_download:
## sequential_download (boolean):
## Default value: false. If true, torrent pieces are requested in order. This
## is used to help prevent disk congestion on slow disks such as USB drives.
## This value is always applied from utserver.conf.

# compact_allocation:
## compact_allocation (boolean):
## Default value: false. If true, torrent pieces are appended to the end of
## the files as they come in and rearranged dynamically. The downside of
## compact allocation is currently it does not work with mutlifile torrents
## where we are selectively downloading only some of the files. This value is
## always applied from utserver.conf.

# prealloc_space:
## prealloc_space (boolean):
## Default value: false. If true, disk space for a torrent is allocated before
## the first piece is written to disk. Note that this is not compatible with
## and overrides compact_allocation. This value is always applied from
## utserver.conf.

# minimize_kernel_caching:
## minimize_kernel_caching (boolean):
## Default value: false. If true all disk handles opened on a win32/vfat
## filesystem will be flagged for synchronous I/O when they are opened and
## torrents downloaded to these filesystems will have compact allocation
## enabled. This will minimize a hang that can occur when the kernel disk
## cache becomes full when writing to USB devices formatted as win32/vfat.
## This value is always applied from utserver.conf.

# all_writes_sync:
## all_writes_sync (boolean):
## Default value: false. If true, all writable disk handles opened are flagged
## for synchronous I/O disk space for a torrent is allocated before the first
## piece is written to disk. This value is always applied from utserver.conf.

# randomize_bind_port:
## randomize_bind_port (boolean):
## Default value: false. If true, a random port will be chosen as the peer
## port at startup, even if the user has chosen a different peer port during
## the previous run of the product. If false, the value of the bind_port
## setting will apply. This value is applied from utserver.conf only at
## program start.

# token_auth_filter:
## token_auth_filter (string):
## Default value: all. Determines which set of IP addresses will require the
## use of token authentication. Value considered only when the
## token_auth_enable setting has a value of true. The value remote will
## require token authentication from remote IP addresses. The value all will
## require token authentication from all IP addresses. This value is applied
## from utserver.conf only at program start.

# encrypt_buffer_size:
## encrypt_buffer_size (integer):
## Default value: 102400. Minimum value: 4096. For builds including OpenSSL,
## determines the size of the encryption buffer allocated for SSL
## communications. This value is applied from utserver.conf only at program
## start.

##
## Regular Settings
##

# bind_port:
## bind_port (integer):
## Default value: 6881. Port used for BitTorrent protocol. This can be any
## value in the range 1025-65000.

# max_ul_rate:
## max_ul_rate (integer):
## Default value: -1. Maximum total upload rate in kilobytes per second. -1
## means unlimited. We recommend setting it to -1.

# max_ul_rate_seed:
## max_ul_rate_seed (integer):
## Default value: -1. Maximum per-torrent upload rate when seeding, in
## kilobytes per second. -1 means unlimited. We recommend setting it to -1.

# conns_per_torrent:
## conns_per_torrent (integer):
## Default value: 50. Maximum number of connections for a given torrent.

# max_total_connections:
## max_total_connections (integer):
## Default value: 200. Maximum number of connection opened at the same time.

# auto_bandwidth_management:
## auto_bandwidth_management (boolean):
## Default value: true. If true, upload bandwidth is automatically throttled
## in order to not impact other applications using TCP/IP.

# max_dl_rate:
## max_dl_rate (integer):
## Default value: -1. Maximum total download rate in kilobytes per second. -1
## means unlimited. We recommend setting it to -1.

# seed_ratio:
## seed_ratio (integer):
## Default value: 0. Seed ratio in percent (%) (e.g. 100 means 100%). If not
## 0, seeding will stop after reaching this upload/download ratio.

# seed_time:
## seed_time (integer):
## Default value: 0. Time after which seeding will stop, in seconds. 0 means
## seeding won't stop.

##
## Reloadable Settings
##

## Many of these settings are only read from the configuration file when the
## µTorrent settings file settings.dat does not already exist in the settings
## directory. Once settings.dat exists, the values specified in the configuration
## file for these settings will be ignored, and the values stored in settings.dat
## will be used. For other settings, the server will load the values from the
## configuration file every time the program starts or receives a request to
## reload the configuration file.

## The settings for which the values are always applied from the configuration
## file when the file is read by the server include:

## • dir_download
## • dir_request
## • disk_cache_max_size
## • localhost_authentication
## • logmask
## • preferred_interface
## • progressive_piece_span
## • uconnect_enable
## • uconnect_password
## • uconnect_username
## • ut_webui_dir
## • write_coalesce_max_size
